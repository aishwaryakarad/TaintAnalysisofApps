# TaintAnalysisofApps
analysed 25 apps on GCloud VM for analysis of private information leakage
1. Download/Clone this repository:
https://github.com/arguslab/Argus-SAF
This is the framework that I have used to statically analyse the apps and see if they are safe to use or not. 

2. I had 25 APKs given by a professor for analysis. Because of legal issues I am not uploading those APKs on GitHub but contact me 
   if you want to try and test this yourself. The names are provided in the report
